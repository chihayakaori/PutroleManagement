## **How to Use the Program :**

1. **Install Python :** If you haven't done so already, begin by installing Python on your operating system.

## **Commands :**

**User Commands :** 
- Use the command `$sub` followed directly by the password to obtain the role.
- The `$clear` command allows you to delete messages from the bot, keeping your direct messages clean.

**Admin Commands :**
- Use the command `$set` to add new passwords instead of directly modifying the YAML file.

⚠️ Please note that these commands function only in direct messages.
---

## **Remaining Tasks for Project PutroleM :**
- Implement unlimited usage of passwords.
- Create specific passwords for different roles.

## **⚠️Important Note :**
The bot revokes roles from all users upon the expiration date. Therefore, even if a user receives a role one day before expiration, it will be removed the following day.

The YAML file can be modified while the bot is running, any changes will be taken into account in real-time.
